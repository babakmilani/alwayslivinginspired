            This autumn, menswear is defined by a return to thoughtful simplicity and texture. The key is in
            **investment
            pieces** that layer beautifully and stand the test of time. Forget fast-fashion trends; this is about
            building
            a wardrobe foundation that exudes quiet confidence and sophistication. These four items are the building
            blocks
            you need to master fall style.

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em; color: #646cff; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">1. The Structured Wool
                Overcoat</h2>
            <p>
                The overcoat isn't just an outer layer; it's the anchor of your entire cold-weather look. For Fall 2025,
                it needs **structure**. Look for heavy wool or cashmere blends in timeless colors like charcoal, navy,
                or
                camel. The fit should be slightly relaxed but still sharp in the shoulder. It instantly elevates a
                simple
                turtleneck and jeans or finishes a full tailored suit.

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em; color: #646cff; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">2. Relaxed-Fit Pleated
                Trousers</h2>
            <p>
                Say goodbye to overly slim fits. The modern trouser silhouette is **wider and more comfortable**, often
                featuring a single or double pleat. These provide a relaxed drape that works well with chunky knits and
                adds a subtle sophistication to your casual wear. Choose fabrics like fine wool twill or a heavier
                cotton
                in muted tones of olive, cream, or rich brown.

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em; color: #646cff; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">3. The Chunky
                Cable-Knit
                Sweater</h2>
            <p>
                Texture is king for fall, and the cable-knit sweater is the most reliable way to embrace it. It should
                be
                **substantial and slightly oversized** for that perfect cozy-but-polished look. Cream, forest green, or
                deep burgundy are perfect seasonal choices. Layer it over a simple white tee, or let it peak out from
                under your structured overcoat for contrast.

            <h2 style="font-size: 1.8em; color: #646cff; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 15px;">4. Classic Leather
                Brogues or Boots</h2>
            <p>
                Footwear should be practical but refined. A pair of well-shined **leather brogues or sturdy Chelsea
                boots** in black or deep chocolate brown are non-negotiable. They ground the wider silhouette of the new
                trousers and provide a clean, mature finish to any ensemble, from weekend casual to office-ready.
